    "According to [U.S. Department of Education](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/new-state-state-college-attainment-numbers-show-progress-toward-2020-goal), the college attainment rate of the State of California (37.6%) is below the national average (38.8%). One way to increase the number of college-going students is to increase the number of students applying to colleges.  \n",
    "\n",
    "According to the [California Department of Education](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sd/cb/ceffingertipfacts.asp), the State of California has over 1,000 school districts (including 346 Unifed, 525 Elementary, 78 High, and 88 Other). Amongst these school districts, there is significant heterogeneity in terms of enrollment sizes, budget allocations, family and student demographics (e.g., socio-economic status(SES)). Moreover, school quality, educational outcomes, and college readniness differ largely across there school districts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to increase the number of student applying to 4-year colleges, and ultimately to increase college attendance and attainment, the Department of Education is proposing a \"Test for Success CA\" Program to the State of California, which aims to provide extra funding for school distrcts that have low college application rates.   \n",
    "\n",
    "With these funding, the school districts can implement relevant interventions, such as free test prep workshops and fee waivers. The goal of this program is to have more students apply to four-year colleges. Unfortunately, many of the schools and school districts do not have data on students' four-year college application status, namely whether a student has applied to four-year colleges.  "

    "The SAT and ACT are standardized tests that many colleges and universities in the United States require for their admissions process. This score is used along with other materials such as grade point average (GPA) and essay responses to determine whether or not a potential student will be accepted to the university.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SAT has two sections of the test: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing and Math. The ACT has 4 sections: English, Mathematics, Reading, and Science, with an additional optional writing section. They have different score ranges, which you can read more about on their websites or additional outside sources (a quick Google search will help you understand the scores for each test):\n",

    "\n",
    "Although schools have made SAT/ACT requirement optional for their Fall 2021 applications, submitting SAT/ACT scores had been one of the mandatory requirements for college applications. School admission officials use SAT/ACT scores for admissions decisions and awarding merit-based scholarships. Because SAT/ACT tests are not free (fee waivers are available for qualifying students) and require students a significant amount of time to study and prepare, not all students take SAT/ACT tests; as a result, not all student can apply and attend college. This issue is especially daunting for schools and school districts with a high distribution of low-income, minority students. These students not only lack the resources but also the readiness to take SAT/ACT tests and further apply and attend college. Thus, states should identify interventions, recommend programs, and allocate resources to these districts in need. "

    "- Stage 2: school districts have school participation rates below state average\n",
    "- Stage 3: all school districts in California \n",

    "**Next Step:** \n",
    "- Approve and implement the \"Test for Success CA\" Project\n",
    "- School districts in stage 1 to do a in-house check and proposal school-level programs/interventions to use the budget\n",

    "- The working committee to discuss plans for Stage 2 implementation\n",

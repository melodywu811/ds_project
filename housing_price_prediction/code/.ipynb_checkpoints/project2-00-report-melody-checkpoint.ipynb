    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Since houses do not come with a price tag, sellers and buyers often have to make their best estimation when listing or bidding. In some cases, people can get ripped off when sellers underestimate or when buyers overestimate the values. However, on the other hand, there is a great opportunity for real estate investors to make a good fortune in this market. There two problems I hope to solve here by building and evaluating a regression model for predicting the home values when given a list of property characteristics:\n",
    "1. to provide a tool for sellers and buyers to make accurate estimations on home values and reach fair deals (this tool will be free of charge for everyone!)\n",
    "2. to help real estate investors to identify undervalued homes and provide consulting services for potential improvement to increase the home values.  \n",
